  "abstract": "The Internet of Things! Existential menace or meaningless buzzword? Automating away drudgery or just eroding privacy? Cornucopia or Panopticon?\r\n\r\nThe negative side of the argument is eloquently expressed, often under the catchy name “The Internet of Shit”. But why such skepticism in a world of rampant technophilia? Why are we not, in fact, welcoming our robot overlords?\r\n\r\nThis talk looks at the very real problems of the IoT, with examples from recent news, and looks at how to learn from the criticisms to identify potential solutions."
