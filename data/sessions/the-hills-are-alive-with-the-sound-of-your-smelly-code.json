  "abstract": "This is a demonstration of a code quality analysis tool that doesn‚Äôt visualise the metrics ‚Äì it ‚Äúaudiolises‚Äù them.\r\n\r\nThe concepts of poor code having smell and colour (usually red) is commonly accepted, but what about appealing to our sense of hearing as well as eyes and nose?  Aeolian is an open source tool (written by the author) that generates MIDI music from code quality metrics, which begs the question:\r\n\r\nWhat does poor quality code sound like? Justin Beiber‚Äôs latest? A Phillip Glass soundtrack? A Phil Spector wall of sound cacophony? Modern Jazz? üôÇ\r\n\r\nLikewise, what does good quality code sound like? Mozart? White noise?\r\n\r\nHow do commonly accepted musical concepts (keys, tempo, verse, chorus) apply when illustrating code quality.\r\n\r\nThe author (an amateur musician and long time producer of smelly code) will talk through the concepts of Aeolian and provide plenty of examples of how you can map code quality to music. \r\n\r\nThis will be a light-hearted talk and no knowledge of music theory is needed."
