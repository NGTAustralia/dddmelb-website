  "abstract": "It's been 8 years since the first DDD Melbourne launched and 8 years is a long time in IT. From talks about jQuery, the new C# async feature, different XAML libraries for WPF or Odata, to Serverless Computing, React, Haskell and GraphQL. My how times have changed!\r\n\r\nAs someone who's had the opportunity to be involved in nearly every DDD Melbourne watching the shift in the years about what we've been talking about has given a fascinating insight into the industry that we work in.\r\n\r\nSo let's have a trip down the history of DDD and look back at what we were talking about, learn where we've come from as a community and see if we can make some predictions about where we're going."
