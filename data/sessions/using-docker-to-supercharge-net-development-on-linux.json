  "abstract": "With the release of .NET Core, the long-awaited dream of running .NET natively on Linux is finally here! Even better, .NET Core has arrived just in time for the coming container revolution! \r\n\r\nIn this talk I will be covering getting started with .NET Core on Linux, including a progressive approach to introducing Docker starting with CLI and tooling all the way up to a fully containerised application in a short, but practical development scenario.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we will get started with a basic Hello, World! in C# on a Linux host and demonstrate how Docker can be used not just in production, but also during development to not just simplify the Linux development experience, but also to enable powerful new capabilities including cross-platform scripting, seamless scaling, reproducible builds and simple testing."
