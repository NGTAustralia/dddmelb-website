  "abstract": "Swift is a cross platform open source functional language beloved by thousands of developers worldwide. Many leading IT companies, such as IBM, Apple (troll face) or Google (double troll face) are using Swift for many different domains. It is one of the most popular languages around the globe (in the top 20 according to the Tiobe index) mainly due to mobile development. However, Swift is a very powerful tool for micro services development. \r\n\r\nIn this workshop, we will go step by step through creating a functional micro service. We will install a swift compiler, a back-end framework and write a simple restful service.\r\n\r\nPrerequisites: macOS Sierra, Ubuntu 14.04, internet connection"
