  "abstract": "Ok, it is not as dramatic as death, but you do not want your app to crash, do you?\r\nYou would be amazed by how seemingly innocent line of code could double or triple your app's memory footprint. I have been doing mobile apps for the last 5 years, and I have done lots of work on performance and memory optimisation. \r\nI would like to show you common causes of memory leaks and performance bottlenecks. I would show you figures, so we talk in quantifiable numbers, not just in terms of what's good to do. The talk will also include live profiling of apps to show the impact of small adjustments."
