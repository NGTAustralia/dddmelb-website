  "abstract": "Although Git is an amazingly powerful distributed source control system that has quickly become the industry default, it is surprising to see its true potential go almost completely unused in so many projects. Fear and/or lack of confidence force many developers to use only the bare minimum of Git's capabilities, but like many things in our professional practice, time and energy spent up-front in understanding and using Git better will stand your projects in good stead, and enable faster more reliable delivery of software features to end users.\r\nThis talk is aimed at presenting an unashamedly \"opinionated\" approach to using Git in a team environment. We will endeavour to demonstrate how features like rebase, cherry-pick, bisect and others can be used to create branch histories that are easier to review, safer to merge, and a breeze when it comes understanding where a bug or \"feature\" was introduced. This talk will change the way you view your source control, from merely a background tool that you use to submit code to a first class partner in quality software development."
