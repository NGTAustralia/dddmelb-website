  "abstract": "So you, or your workplace, identifies you as an architect, what now?\r\n\r\nThere are countless amounts of available material on software architecture and design patterns, but comparatively little on how to be a software architect.  Being an effective architect is a whole lot more than having a toolkit of patterns and practices!\r\n\r\nIn this talk Stephen will draw upon his years of experience working on architectural solutions and mentoring other architects.  Among other things, the talk will cover:\r\n\r\n- Attitudes and behaviours\r\n- Getting your way\r\n- Gaining the respect of the business\r\n- Considerations outside those of a developer\r\n\r\nThis talk is for practitioners from those early in their software architecture foray, to those just seeking some group therapy."
