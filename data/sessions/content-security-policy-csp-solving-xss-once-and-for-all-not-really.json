  "abstract": "Handling cross-site scripting (XSS) attack is an age-old problem for web application developers and with all the tools and libraries built for it, still hackers tend to find innovative ways to bypass all the filters and validations. Content Security Policy (CSP) handles the problem at its source, i.e. the browser. Using CSP, browsers get smart enough to distinguish the legitimate scripts from malicious ones.\r\nIn this talk, we'll discuss major CSP use cases and review their common pitfalls and by the end you'll realise that CSP is the missing half you were always looking for."
