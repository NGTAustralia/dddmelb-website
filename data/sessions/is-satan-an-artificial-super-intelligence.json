  "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence is considered by many to become a booming field in the coming years. However, Elon Musk and others has put a strong position of stopping artificial intelligence in our future. Last year we explored the coming social issues arising from automation. This year we will take it a step further and find out what dangers we could face with AI.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I'll present the limitations of AI, what effects data mining the hive mind could have on our control of life, the hard problem of consciousness and how robots could solve it, the ethical issues of trans-humanism and finally discuss whether our universe as a computer simulation. \r\n\r\nYou may leave with more questions than answers but hopefully you can have a head start to decide the future of the human race."
