  "abstract": "Software development. Solution architecture. Test driven development. Domain driven design. Cloud. Static vs dynamic typing. Test coverage. Pull requests. Package management. Infrastructure automation. Identity management. Security.\r\n\r\nThe above represent the tip of the successful delivery iceberg.\r\n\r\nSoftware exists for people, and working with those people is the key to succesful delivery. Success in software delivery starts before the team's boots hit the ground, and continues to be measured beyond the final sprint review.\r\n\r\nIn this session we will take a look at some targeted, specific non-technical practices and behaviours you and your team can employ to vastly increase your chances of a successful software delivery."
