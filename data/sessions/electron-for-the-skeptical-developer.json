  "abstract": "Electron is a new framework for building cross-platform applications using Node and web technologies. For curious developers, whether you build desktop or web applications, you may want to know more but aren't sure how to get started.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I'll share my experience having my world turned upside down:\r\n\r\n - using React and Node (and some C++) to replace my WPF and C# experience\r\n - how the Electron architecture differs from other GUI technologies\r\n - the fun and shenanigans that come with doing JavaScript day-to-day\r\n - navigating the Electron and Node ecosystems, and some of the amazing community work you should check out\r\n - war stories from the development of GitHub Desktop\r\n\r\nLearning a new stack and shipping something soon was a big change but ultimately a really enjoyable experience, and with everything being open source it's been great to be able to contribute back to the technologies I rely on.\r\n\r\nThis is a lot of ground to cover in a short time, but please bring your questions, curiosity and heckling!"
