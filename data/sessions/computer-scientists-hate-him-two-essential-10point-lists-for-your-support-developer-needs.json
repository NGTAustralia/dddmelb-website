  "abstract": "Software support can sometimes be a very different beast compared to the initial development phase of a project, be it agile or otherwise. They can come in all manner of shapes and sizes and be taken on under a variety of circumstances - particularly in the world of consultation.\r\nIn this presentation I'll go over two areas of key importance to support software developers with a 10 point list covering each.\r\nFirst, with an emphasis on client engagement and maintaining existing software, support work comes with a different set of challenges to greenfield development. I'll go over my top 10 list of skills and qualities that make an effective support developer, complete with some do and don't examples.\r\nAdditionally, we'll look at a 10 item handover checklist I have developed that covers things that a support developer would love to have when getting started. They can be taken as a useful template or starting point, which can come in handy if you're looking for a way to improve or update your support development processes."
