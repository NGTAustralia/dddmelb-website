  "abstract": "So I developed my application and built a Docker image. Now what ? \r\nWhere and how do I deploy it ? \r\nHow do I make sure it is healthy and always running ? \r\nHow do I get servers to host it ? \r\nHow do I manage those servers ? \r\n\r\nKubernetes on Azure container services solves this problem and in this session, we will do a deep dive on building micro services, containerising them and deploying them onto Azure container services"
