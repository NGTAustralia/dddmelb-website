  "abstract": "For most developers, looking for a new job is a nightmare. Applying for hundreds of jobs online, dealing with recruiters who think Java and JavaScript are \"pretty much the same\", interviews with HR, and maybe, if you somehow survive all of this, a technical interview.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me about a time when you resolved conflict within your team\"\r\n\"What are your biggest weaknesses?\"\r\n\"Where do you see yourself in 5 years?\"\r\n\r\nHow do you get past all of this junk to show off your actual skills? You're a developer after all, not a salesman. What do they even want to hear? Why can't they just ask me to discuss why tabs are better than spaces? Or how I'd implement middle-out compression to decrease storage requirements"
