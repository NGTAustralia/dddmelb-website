  "abstract": "As a front-end, full-stack and/or mobile app developer, using APIs is inevitable. However, what if those APIs are not yet implemented? Should I wait for back-end developers to complete API implementation? Nah, we don't need to wait for them as long as those API definitions are defined via RAML or Swagger. \r\n \r\nIn this session, Justin will talk about how beneficial API design-first approach will be, then how API spec is designed and mocked on MuleSoft API Manager, Azure API Management and Amazon API Gateway so that front-end, full-stack and/or mobile app developers can play around until the actual API implementations are done."
