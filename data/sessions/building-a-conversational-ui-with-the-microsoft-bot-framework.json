  "abstract": "The popularity of Conversational User Interfaces has grown thanks to the availability of services like Cortana, Google Now and Siri. The conversational experience is becoming an expectation in userâ€™s digital interaction with applications and services. However, few developers have the expertise required to create conversational experiences in their applications and services. This is where the Microsoft Bot Framework and the Language Understanding Intelligent Service (LUIS) comes to the rescue!\r\n\r\nThe Microsoft Bot Framework and LUIS provide tools to help write high-quality conversational bots and publish them to services such as Skype, Facebook and Slack, all while sharing the same code base!\r\n\r\nJoin me as I take you through the building blocks of the Microsoft Bot Framework, to prototyping your first chat bot in minutes, and adding natural language understanding capabilities with LUIS."
