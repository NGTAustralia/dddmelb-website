  "abstract": "Too often we build our user interfaces first, then we build disjointed APIs to expose specific functionality or to connect to other systems. The API-First approach advocates for designing a coherent, complete API before anything else, analogous to a Mobile First approach. A clear API designed for developers will be easier to extend with new interfaces (like IoT) as well as enabling future integrations that couldnâ€™t be imagined today."
