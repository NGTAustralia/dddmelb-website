  "abstract": "Apps have transformed the way we work and do things; but they only truly work when they are connected. Traditionally, connecting applications required specialised skills and niche integration knowledge that not every developer wanted to learn. \r\n\r\nHowever, the increasing diversity of apps and the growing availability of APIs result in much greater integration demands. Luckily, now we have Azure Logic Apps, a rich, robust, fully-managed and very cool Integration Platform as a Service (iPaaS) that enable us to integrate, with speed and ease, not only the new and shiny apps, but also those legacy systems that were born before the API era.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, Paco will share the magic of Logic Apps and show how to easily build “serverless” integration apps based on this Azure offering."
