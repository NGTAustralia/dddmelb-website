  "abstract": "About a year ago, I joined a team that was starting from scratch on a new project.\r\n\r\n\"And we're going to do it in JavaScript!\"\r\n\r\nIf you feel uncomfortable at hearing that detail, come along and hear about how we (a team of developers who weren't strong in JavaScript skills) shipped the project a year later and found it a (mostly) pleasant experience.\r\n\r\nI'll talk about how we settled on TypeScript, the tooling around TypeScript that helps keep everything under control, and show how you can put together a toolchain and process that balances moving quickly with producing correct code!"
