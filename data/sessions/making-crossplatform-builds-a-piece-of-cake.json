  "abstract": "This session will be an in-depth dive into using Cake (C# Make) to automate, orchestrate and supercharge your builds.\r\n\r\nDuring the session I will be covering getting started with Cake, putting together your first build script and how to take your builds to the next level including build, test, packaging, publishing and deployment across any platform.\r\nI'll also be outlining how to integrate Cake with your favourite editors, tools, cloud platforms and CI providers, across Windows, macOS and Linux! From Visual Studio to Azure, AppVeyor to Yeoman, Cake makes it easy to automate and control your builds, all with the full power of C# and .NET!\r\nThis session will include simple demos to go from a basic .NET solution to a complete cross-platform CI and CD pipeline using a single Cake script."
