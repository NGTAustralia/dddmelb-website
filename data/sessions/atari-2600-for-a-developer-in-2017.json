  "abstract": "Atari, it was out in 1977, it gave to many of us our first glance of home video games. How did they work? I mean, I am pretty sure there was not C# in 1977!\r\nVote and come to my talk to listen to a short story of hardcore development (no, seriously, hardcore), inspiring engineering tales and a moment to go full geek into the overlooked marriage between software and hardware.\r\nI promise no assembler knowledge required... Well, mostly."
