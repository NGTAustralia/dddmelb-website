  "abstract": "A number of software development consultancies have been influential in the Software Craftsmanship movement - names like 8th Light, Codurance & RoleModel Software are prominent in this space.  Organisations such as these have been influential in shaping the Software Craftsmanship Manifesto and placing themselves at the forefront of innovation in Software Craftsmanship.\r\n\r\nHowever, is Software Craftsmanship leadership, innovation and execution exclusive and sacred to consultancies only?  What can a largish corporate learn from these organisations and infuse in their Software Development culture?\r\n\r\nThis session will argue that the different perspectives on the discipline of Software Development are valid and complementary - be it an engineering discipline, a trade or a craft.  It will also paint a picture of how a Software Craftsmanship mindset can be exploited to positively influence an organisations overall Software Development culture."
