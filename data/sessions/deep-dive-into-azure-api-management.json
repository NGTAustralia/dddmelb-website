  "abstract": "Azure API Management (APIM) is a platform as a service offering that allows publishing HTTP APIs to both external apps, B2B partners and even internal developers. It allows crating API gateways quickly with security, policies and monitoring support.\r\nThis talk is from my own experience with using Azure APIM at my work to create an API ecosystem on Azure. This talk is about using APIM for enterprise integration with client apps from internet calling into APIs deployed to Azure and in turn the APIs calling into on-premises services.\r\n\r\n* Overview of Azure APIM and the features it provides\r\n* How policies work and a look at some policies.\r\n* Publishing an API\r\n* Using APIM within a private Virtual Network\r\n* Custom domain name with subdomains\r\n* Mutual authentication with client certificate\r\n* JWT Validation\r\n* Proxying SOAP web services \r\n* Logging API calls\r\n* Monitoring\r\n* Disaster recovery\r\nI will talk of some lessons learned from the field about Azure APIM."
