Now, we see serverless applications. How can we test those applications? That's a tricky question. \r\n \r\nIn this session, Justin will demo how serverless applications, especially Azure Functions and Logic Apps, are written with considering testability. Then he will also show how those apps can be tested in a continuous integration pipeline, with various approach."
