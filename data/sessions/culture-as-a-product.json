  "abstract": "Forget SaaS, IaaS and PaaS - CaaP is where it’s at. People seem to ignore the importance of the culture and how it directly affects creativity, research, morale and the overall product. I’m here to prove to you, beautiful audience members, that a product is more than just the methodology, the technology or its utility; in the end, it's the culture that will define the product and differentiate it from the plethora of competitors.  Ignoring culture, and by extension your employees, could very well mean doom for your business."
