  "abstract": "We all want to build secure, resilient software. However, real-world software development with budget and time pressures is a fine balancing act of compromises and risk taking. So how do we decide which controls to implement and which can be left out? How many controls do you need to be secure?\r\n \r\nIn this talk, Liam will draw upon lessons learned from historical fortifications and use real world technical examples to illustrate how simple criteria can be used to assess security controls, and how these controls can be combined into secure architectural patterns."
