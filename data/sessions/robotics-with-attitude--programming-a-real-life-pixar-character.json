  "abstract": "Anki's Cozmo palm-sized robot mixes Humour, Animation, AI and best of all - it's programmable! Learn what makes this robot tick and how to get started with the Cozmo SDK. Learn how to perform facial recognition, path planning, SLAM (Simultaneous Location and Mapping) and portray emotions without a 4 year degree in robotics. Building upon my DDD by Night lightning talk we will develop a simple application for Cozmo resulting in complex behaviour ... assuming he chooses to cooperate!"
