  "abstract": "As the founder of a tech startup I get to make all the decisions about what technologies to use. And we have tried all[1] of them and even kept some of them.\r\nJoin me in a series of HonestTrailers for some of the hottest technologies out there. Amongst others: Server-Side Rendering, Lambda, New JavaScript Features, Honeycomb, All[2] of the new AWS products & Vue.js.\r\n\r\n[1] Of course not actually *all* of them. It would take an infinite amount of monkey and laptops to try *just* the new JavaScript Frameworks..\r\n[2] Maybe not all of these either. Amazon is only less prolific than open source JavaScript developers"
