  "abstract": "Startups usually don't hire testers, but ours did. In this talk we'll explore why our startup hired us instead of just hiring developers, how it worked out for us and our journey to evolve into a testerless environment.\n\nOur combined experience spans over three decades working in IT which allowed us to help the teams in our Startup develop capabilities in exploratory, performance and automated testing.\n\nWe will also discuss how we managed to keep our jobs after we successfully made ourselves redundant."
