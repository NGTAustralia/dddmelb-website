  "abstract": "While we can all agree that git is an incredibly useful collaboration tool, it's also quite a complicated one. It can be tempting to treat git commands a bit like magic spells - if you type this string of words, then that thing happens, but it's not really obvious why. This talk is going to demystify all that. We'll have a look under git's covers and see how it organises itself and tracks your changes, and what actually happens when you stage and commit code. We won't be going through a list of commands memorising syntax. Instead, we'll be concentrating on the basic concepts that git operates on - so at least when it doesn't do what you want, you'll know why!"
