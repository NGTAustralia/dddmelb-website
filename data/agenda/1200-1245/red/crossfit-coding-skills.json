  "abstract": "I know I know, you're like Crossfit? and Coding? What? Well in my life and experience they aren't at all that different and in my talk I will discuss the transferable skills that I have found that apply to both.\n\nThe focus in my talk is the discussion of soft-skills that I believe that can make you a better engineer and a better Crossfitter (or physical athlete in any capacity).\n\nSubjects that will be discussed include mental fortitude (doing a workout with over 100 reps requires you to fight through when you mind says quit and sometimes we have to push code out on a deadline even when we're exhausted), tackling complex problems one step at a time (debugging code sometimes requires going one line by one line and doing a heavy snatch in CF requires the same), keeping the long-game in mind (getting to build complex applications does not happen in a day and neither does building up your squat weight), and celebrating the small victories (you built that front-end page as a programmer and today you got your first toes-to-bar).\n\nWith this talk I hope to engage people with the concept that rather than compartmentalizing themselves between being a programmer - and then everything else, to see themselves as a holistic being and become more conscious of themselves."
