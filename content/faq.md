  <li>
    <a class="toggleAccordion" href="javascript:void(0);">Can I pay by cheque, invoice, cash, Coinye West?</a>
    <div class="inner">
      <p>No - this year all payments will be via EventBrite. It's vastly easier for us as organisers to only accept payments using EventBrite, which currently doesn't allow payments to be made by Diners or rapper themed bitcoins. Please consider using EventBrite with your own credit card, and claiming it back on expenses. The cost is low, so it should easily fall within your expenses limit!</p>
