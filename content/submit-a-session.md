We welcome sessions from any dev related topic. Previously we have had a wide range of sessions from Agile to C++ to JavaScript to Haskell. If voters or our in-house Panel think your session is relevant or interesting it's in!

This year we have two entry options. Submit to Open Voting using the inline form below and your session will go on this website for voting via ticket holders! Alternatively, you can submit to the in-house Panel where a number of industry people will carefully select sessions, they will not go through the Open Voting process. You can only submit the same talk via one of these options.

Before submitting a session please consider the following:

- Sessions are not a sales presentation although you are welcome to have a slide or two about yourself and your company
- You will probably not have internet access
- We will open voting about a month prior to the event. If your session gets voted in and you agree to present, then this is a serious commitment
- Experienced presenter, Author & MVP Guy Smith Ferrier has some great advice on [how to give a great presentation](http://guysmithferrier.com/Downloads/HowToGiveGreatPresentations.pdf)

To submit a session to the in-house Panel for the private selection process please enter the session details on [this form here](https://goo.gl/forms/HN2RR22JkyEsSaCI3).

The Open Voting is now closed, so please submit to the in-house process using the form above.
